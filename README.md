# Create Cloud Block
A boilerplate generator for building [Gutenberg Cloud](https://gutenbergcloud.org/) blocks.

This generator is inspired by both [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [Create Guten Block](https://github.com/ahmadawais/create-guten-block). However, it is only intended to serve as a boilerplate and not a zero-configuration toolkit.


## Overview

```
$ npm init cloud-block my-block
$ cd my-block
```

## Development

You can now start editing the block. To test the block with [g-editor](https://github.com/front/g-editor) (a minimalist version of the Gutenberg editor) run:

```
$ npm start
```

## Deployment

Once you're ready you can follow the deployment steps.

```
$ npm run build
$ npm publish
```
