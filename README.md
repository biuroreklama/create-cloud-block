# Create Cloud Block
A boilerplate generator for building [Gutenberg Cloud](https://gutenbergcloud.org/) blocks.

This generator is inspired by both [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [Create Guten Block](https://github.com/ahmadawais/create-guten-block). However, it is only intended to serve as a boilerplate and not a zero-configuration toolkit.


## Overview

```
$ npx create-cloud-block my-block
$ cd my-block
$ npm start
```

Then open http://localhost:3000/ to see your block running on an instance of the Gutenberg-js editor.


## Deployment

```
$ npm run build
$ npm publish
```
